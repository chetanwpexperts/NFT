                    <p class="p1">1. &nbsp; &nbsp; The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile.

We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Digital assets will not lose money.</p>
                    <p class="p1">2. &nbsp; &nbsp;You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Digital assets transactions. Neither NFT-X nor any other NFT-X Party is responsible for determining the taxes that apply to Digital assets transactions.</p>
                    <p class="p1">3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Our Service does not store, send, or receive Digital assets. This is because Digital assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on its supporting blockchain. Any transfer of Digital assets occurs within the supporting blockchain and not on this Service.</p>
                    <p class="p1">4. &nbsp; &nbsp;There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that NFT-X will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Digital assets, however caused.</p>
                    <p class="p1">5. &nbsp; &nbsp;A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of Digital assets.</p>
                    <p class="p1">6. &nbsp; &nbsp;The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Auction and/or Service and the utility of Digital assets.</p>

NFT-X reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase may become inaccessible on NFT-X. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view your assets on NFT-X serve as grounds for a claim against NFT-X.</p>
